1. The purpose of a database is to accurately represent and store large amounts of data.

2. The most commonly used type of database is the relational database.

3. One example of this type of database shows the relationship of the user to the client.

Client: user id, last name, first name, email address, rank
User: user id, department id, rank

4. the primary id is user id for client and department id for user.
the department id key could be the surrogate key in the client table.

5. Thhe surrogate key relates 2 otherwise unrelated sets of data.
In this case, the client contains the surrogate key.

6. Without the surrogate key, the 2 charts would be unrelated if the user id was different as a client than as a user.

7. In charts, information is recorded as data. Information entered into the system becomes data, which represents, but does not always resemble the information.

8. For instance, the data John Searle could be represented as 0001011urd3928. The computer is expected to know that these are equivalent.

9. A single user database could be something like a chronology of events such as all previous addresses, emails and phone numbers of a single person and the times that they were changed.

10. Problems that may occur are improper recording of the data, transcription errors, incorrect data, or spam or spoof data (irrelevant data).
